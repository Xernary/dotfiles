# Personal Arch configuration files

Here are the dotfiles I've created to customize my Arch based system.

Note: If you want to clone this repo be aware that some features might not work. For example, some of the hyprlands keybinds use some dependencies or some custom tools I made to offer some functionalities; this tools are not provided in this repo so some stuff might break.
